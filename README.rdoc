= Settings Generator

On most of my projects at work (APIs and their accompanying CMS apps) we have need 
of settings that can be stored in the database, and updated by our staff. Perhaps 
the version of our app on the Beta server needs to communicate with a 3rd party's 
test platform, while the version on the Prod server needs to work with the 3rd party's 
production platform. Or maybe you just want Bill in Accounting to specify the 
background color for his spiffy CMS. 
 

== Setup

We can install this generator in a few easy steps:

1) Create our rails project:
  rails spiffycms
  cd spiffycms

2) Run the generator:
  ruby script/generate settings

3) Update our database:
  rake db:migrate

4) Test our new installation:
  rake db:test:prepare
  rake test

 
== Usage
 
So how do we use it? After installation, there are three ways to use our new settings:
  # Get/Set settings explicitly #
  Setting.set('admin', 'jaime@someurl.com')
  Setting.get('admin')    # returns 'jaime@someurl.com'

  # Get/Set implicitly, which is more fun #
  Setting.admin = 'jaime@someurl.com'
  Setting.admin    # returns 'jaime@someurl.com'

The third way is to launch the app, and go to /settings where you'll be treated to a 
GUI with your basic CRUD functionality. Pretty slick. Be sure, if you have any 
authentication in your app, to include it in settings_controller.rb, or anyone out 
there will be able to change your site's settings. That's no fun.
