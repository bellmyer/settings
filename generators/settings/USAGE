This is very easy to install, with no parameters:

  ruby script/generate settings
  
This will create a settings table that will store
various application settings in your database.

It also creates a Settings controller, which you can
use to manage your app settings.


There are three ways to use settings.  Let's use the example of storing 
the admin's e-mail address in the settings table.

There's the fun and easy way in your code:

	# Set the admin value #
  Setting.admin = 'admin@ilovespam.com'
  
  # Retrieve the admin value #
	Setting.admin
	
There's also the more explicit way in your code, which is good if you
need your setting keys to have funny characters:

	# Set the admin value #
  Setting.set('admin.email', 'admin@ilovespam.com')
  
  # Retrieve the admin value #
  Setting.get('admin.email')
  
Finally, there is also a web interface to manage your settings, in the
controller called "settings".  Be sure to add any filters and/or
authenticatoin to settings_controller.rb if needed.  You don't want
just anyone mucking with your settings!
